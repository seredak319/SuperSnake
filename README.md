# Single Player mode

### Choose the level
* Time challenge - kill 10 snakes in the shortest possible time.
* Level 1 - kill 10 snakes and then face the boss! (the boss is quite slow and doesn't shoot at you, a lot of ammo)
* Level 2 - kill 10 snakes and then face the boss! (the boss is faster and shoot at you, less ammo)
* Level 2 - kill 10 snakes and then face the boss! (the boss is fast and shoot frequently at you, very little ammo)
